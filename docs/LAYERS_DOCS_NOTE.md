The documentation in this section shows each layer as an `object` with `properties` although this is not accurate. These are deck.gl layer classes and the `properties` are those of the `props` that are passed into the constructor of the deck.gl layer classes. For more information, see [deck.gl's documentation on how to use layers](https://deck.gl/docs/developer-guide/using-layers) or [the layer class](https://deck.gl/docs/api-reference/core/layer). We welcome contributions to improve the docs, whether it be small fixes or a new docs site that would allow us to show these classes properly. Thanks!
