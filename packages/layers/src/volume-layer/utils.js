/**
 * Creates a single continguous TypedArray that can visualized as a volume in 3D space where the y-axis going up is positive,
 * the x-axis going right is positive, and the z-axis coming out of the screen is positive.
 * To do this, and keep the orientation, we must anti-diagonally transpose each slice of raster data so that the (0, 0) data point is transformed
 * to the top right.  If you start the camera looking at the 0th slice (or rotate from looking at the final slice) in 3D, this becomes more apparent.
 * Of note here is that in 2D rendering, the y-axis is positive in the downward direction.
 *
 * @param {object} props
 * @param {object} props.source PixelSource
 * @param {object} props.selection A single selection for the PixelSource
 * @param {object} props.onUpdate A callback for progress that is called twice during the loading of each plane, once when the promsie resolves and once when it is loaded into the final contiguous buffer.
 * @param {object} props.downsampleDepth This is the number by which to downsample on the z direction, usually `2 ** resolution` where `resolution` is that of the `PixelSource` in the image pyramid.
 * The idea here is to get every `downsampleDepth` raster slice so that proper scaling is maintained (just liek a 2D image pyramid).
