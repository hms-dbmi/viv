  // Geometrically, the transformed_eye is a position relative to the 0-1 normalized vertices, which themselves are the inverse of the model + scale trasnformation.
  // See below for an example which does not involve a scale transformation, for simplicity, but motivates geometrically the needed transformation on eye_pos.

  Finally, we apply the inverse model matrix transformation to the eye as well to bring it too into world space.
  Notice that the ray here matches the "voxels" through which the first ray also passes, as desired.
