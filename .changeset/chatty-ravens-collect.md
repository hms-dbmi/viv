This release potentially includes backward-incompatible changes. To avoid automatically adopting such releases, ensure you are either pinning the exact version of @hms-dbmi/viv in your package.json file or using a version range syntax that only accepts patch updates, such as ~0.16.1. Refer to npm's semver documentation for details.

    Migrate to deck.gl v9

This update modifies our code internally to support deck.gl v9, dropping compatibility with deck.gl v8.

Impact:

We havenâ€™t changed Viv's public API, but the upgrade to deck.gl 9.0 is considered **breaking** due to changes in its dependencies, which may require updates to WebGL-related code (e.g., shaders, injections, constants). Here are potential issues users may face in migrating:

    - deprecating WebGL1
    - changing any public-facing GL-specific variables to use the new luma.gl backend-agnostic variables (such as `interpolation` on the `ImageLayer`)
    - shader injection-location name changes (i.e., `gl_fragColor` -> `fragColor`)

Action:

    - You will need to upgrade to deck.gl `9.0.x` if it is specified separately or you use other `deck.gl` functionality indpendently of Viv as having two versions is not supported.  The above list of "internally" changing APIs was not exhaustive and only covers the Viv-related changes.  Please see https://deck.gl/docs/upgrade-guide#upgrading-to-v90 for more information.
    - Pin a specific Viv version or semver range to prevent unintended updates.
