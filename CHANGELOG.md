## 0.12.0

### Added

- New `LensExtension` for controlling lensing on layers as a deck.gl extension
  - props like `lensBorderRadius` no longer used directly by the layer in favor of using the `extensions` prop with new `LensExtension` in connjunction with these props. So, to be able to use the lens feature, you must pass in the old props as well as the `LensExtension` to `extensions`.
    - See https://deck.gl/docs/developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-extensions for more information on how to use `extensions` and what they are
- Expose `DECKGL_FILTER_COLOR`, `DECKGL_PROCESS_INTENSITY`, AND `DECKGL_MUTATE_COLOR` hooks and document them.
- Upgrade deck.gl to 8.6
- `extensions` are now the main way for controlling how shaders render the image
  - `LensExtension`, `ColorPaletteExtension`, and `AdditiveColormapExtension` are exported from `viv` to be used mutually exclusively for controlling how the fragment shader renders. The `ColorPaletteExtension` is used by default and provides the normal one color per channel pseudo-coloring. `AdditiveColormapExtension` provides colormaps like `viridis`, `jet` and more. There have been slight changes to the props so please see the docs for more infomation.
  - These extensions are mutually exclusive and only available for 2D layers - for example you will need to add something like the following to your 2D layers for compatibility
  ```
  extensions: (colormap ? [
    new AdditiveColormapExtension(),
  ] : [
    new ColorPaletteExtension(),
  ])
  ```
- Add `@data` alias for serving local data during development
- Add Avivator video tutorial to README.md
- Support basic OME-NGFF in Avivator
- Add support for the `multiscales[].axes` field introduced in OME-NGFF v0.3
- Bump zarr.js to get support for both `/` and `.` dimension separators
- Add `onResolutionChange` callback and resolution indicator in Avivator

- Bold format names in README
- Add description of "Indexed TIFF" to Avivator snackbar warning when offsets are missing
- Refactor `zustand` stores to follow best practice in Avivator.
- Fix `onViewportLoad` callback for `MultiscaleImageLayer`
- There has been a small change to how `transparentColor` is handled - `useTransparentColor` is now necessary for `AdditiveColormapExtension` and `ColorPaletteExtension` to use the feature in addition to `transparentColor` for `ColorPaletteExtension`. The truthiness of `transparentColor` is no longer relied on.
