# Data Preparation

Viv supports a subset of the files generated from the `bioformats2raw` + `raw2ometiff` pipeline, described 
[here](https://www.glencoesoftware.com/blog/2019/12/09/converting-whole-slide-images-to-OME-TIFF.html). 
This guide demonstrates how to generate a pyramidal Zarr or OME-TIFF with Bio-Formats that can be viewed with 
[Avivator](http://avivator.gehlenborglab.org) via HTTP.


### Getting Started

This tutorial requires Bio-Formats [`bioformats2raw`](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw) and 
[`raw2ometiff`](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/raw2ometiff) command-line tools. It's easiest to install 
these tools using [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/), but 
binaries also are available for download on the corresponding github repositories.

```bash
$ conda create --name bioformats python=3.8
$ conda activate bioformats
$ conda install -c ome bioformats2raw raw2ometiff
```


### Input data

Bio-Formats is an incredibly valuable toolkit and supports reading over 
[150 file formats](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.5.1/supported-formats.html). You can choose 
one of your own images, but for the purposes of this tutorial, we will use a multiplexed, high-resolution 
[Perkin Elmer](https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/Vectra-QPTIFF/perkinelmer/) (1.95 GB) image made available 
under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) on OME.

```bash
$ wget https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/images/Vectra-QPTIFF/perkinelmer/PKI_scans/LuCa-7color_Scan1.qptiff 
```

After the image has finished downloading, there are two options for creating an Avivator/Viv-compliant image. 


### Pyramid Generation

#### Option 1: Create a Bio-Formats "raw" Zarr

The first option is to use `bioformats2raw` with `--file_type=zarr`. The default "raw" file type is currently 
[n5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5), so the flag is required to generate the Zarr-based output. This command will
create the OME-XML metadata along with a pyramidal Zarr for high-resolution images.

```bash
$ bioformats2raw LuCa-7color_Scan1.qptiff LuCa-7color_Scan1/ --file_type=zarr
```

`bioformats2raw` creates the file directory `LuCa-7color_Scan1/` which contains the "raw" bioformats output. The root directory 
contains a `METADATA.ome.xml` file along with a `data.zarr/` directory containing the Zarr
output. This output can be viewed directly with [Avivator] by serving the top-level directory (`LuCa-7color_Scan1/`) 
over HTTP ([see below](#viewing-in-avivator)).

> NOTE: Alternate tile dimensions can be specified with the `--tile_width` and `--tile_height` options. 
> In our experience, tile sizes of 512x512 and 1024x1024 (default) work well. Viv can only handle square tiles. For more information 
> see the [docs](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw#performance).


#### Option 2: Create an OME-TIFF

The second option is to run the complete Bio-Formats pipeline to generate a valid OME-TIFF. 

```bash
$ bioformats2raw LuCa-7color_Scan1.qptiff n5_tile_directory/ 
$ raw2ometiff n5_tile_directory/ LuCa-7color_Scan1.ome.tif --compression=zlib
```

> NOTE: Viv currently uses [`geotiff.js`](https://geotiffjs.github.io/) for accessing data from remote TIFFs 
> over HTTP. There is limited compression support in this library, so the `--compression` flag must be specified with
> either `zlib` or `Uncompressed` for viewing in the browser.


### Viewing in Avivator

Avivator is a purely client-side application and relies on access to data over HTTP. Therefore, viewing a dataset locally 
requires a simple web-server. The easist option is to use [`http-server`](https://github.com/http-party/http-server#readme),
which can be installed via `npm` or `Homebrew` if using a Mac:

#### Install `http-server`

```bash
$ npm install --global http-server
# or 
$ brew install http-server
```


#### Starting a Server

From within this directory, start a local server and open [Avivator] in your browser. 

```bash
$ http-server --cors='*' --port 8000 .
```

This command starts a web-server and makes the content in the current directory readable over HTTP. Once the server is running,
open [Avivator] and paste `http://localhost:8000/LuCa-7color_Scan1/` (Zarr) or `http://localhost:8000/LuCa-7color_Scan1.ome.tif` 
(OME-TIFF) into the input dialog to view the respective pyramids generated above. For convenience, you can also create a direct 
link by appending an `image_url` query parameter:

- http://avivator.gehlenborglab.org/?image_url=http://localhost:8000/LuCa-7color_Scan1/ (Zarr)
- http://avivator.gehlenborglab.org/?image_url=http://localhost:8000/LuCa-7color_Scan1.ome.tif (OME-TIFF)

> Troubleshooting: Viv relies on cross-origin requests to retrieve data from servers. The `--cors='*'` flag is important to ensure
> that the appropriate `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response is sent from your local server.


### Final Note on File Formats and OME-Zarr

The Glencoe software and OME teams hava been clear that the "raw" N5/Zarr formats produced by `bioformats2raw` should be considered 
experimental for the time being as intermediates for generating valid OME-TIFFs. Therefore `Option 1` is not as stable as `Option 2` 
for generating images for Avivator/Viv.

However, there is activate community development for a next generation file format (NGFF) called 
[OME-Zarr](https://github.com/ome/omero-ms-zarr/blob/master/spec.md), which can be produced in part by 
running `bioformats2raw --file_type=zarr --dimension-order='XYZCT'`. This will generate a valid multiscale Zarr
which is compatible with OME-Zarr, but is missing some metadata within the Zarr hierarchy. 

Aviviator can view the "raw" output as described above, and the *same* multiscale pyramid can also be viewed 
in desktop analysis tools like [`napari`](https://github.com/napari/napari). 

### Other Examples
Other sample OME-TIFF data can be downloaded from [OME-TIFF sample data](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/5.6.3/ome-tiff/data.html) 
provided by OME and viewed with Viv locally (without needing to run Bio-Formats).
